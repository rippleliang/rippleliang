## About me
A multi-talented person with expertise in Data Analysis, Market Finance & Channel Finance, Operation and Customer Relationship Management, in the past 7 years, I was working in the international teams in Xiaomi, Booking.com and PriceMatch, in Paris, France.

I like to work in the fast-paced, startup environment, with strong communication skills for collaborations among headquarter, area headquarter (EMEA, WEU, APAC) and fast growing local office.

I have experience in optimize operation process for budget management and customer service. I have successfully implemented budget and promotion validation process for country office with self-developed online tools and systems, including business analysis, real-time updated dashboard, rolling forecast, monthly conference report and promotion validation functions. I also have experience in training a new regional team from 0 to more than 20 people, including tasks as building customer service process, monitoring KPI, technical training and task assignment.
